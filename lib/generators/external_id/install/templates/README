ExternalId has been installed!

Next steps:

1. Review and customize the configuration in:
   config/initializers/external_id.rb

2. Run the migration to create the external_ids table:
   rails db:migrate

3. Include the concern in your models:

   class Customer < ApplicationRecord
     include ExternalId::WithExternalId
   end

4. Start using external IDs in your application:

   # Add an external ID to a record
   customer.add_external_id(provider: 'raynet', id: '12345')

   # Find a record by external ID
   customer = Customer.find_by_external_id('raynet', '12345')

   # Get the external ID value object
   external_id = customer.external_id
   external_id.provider  # => 'raynet'
   external_id.id        # => '12345'

5. If FactoryBot was detected, a factory file was created in your
   test factories directory. Customize the :external_id factory
   to link to your models.
